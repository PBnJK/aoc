# Advent of Code 2015...2024 solutions

These are my solutions for every year of Advent of Code. It's still a work in
progress, but should serve nicely as a reference/guide.

My inputs are not tracked by this repo! If you are planning on running any of
these, provide your own--though I don't recommend it; isn't the fun of Advent
of Code building and running _your own_ solutions?
